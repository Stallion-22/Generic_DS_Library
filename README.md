# About Project
- In the project we emulate almost all the data structures and its functionalities which are available in STL

- In this project we have created eight data structures as follows:

    - Doubly Circular LinkList

    - Doubly Linear LinkList

    - Singly Circular LinkList

    - Singly Linear LinkList

    - Stack using LinkList

    - Stack using Array

    - Queue using LinkList

    - Binary Search Tree

- Here we have also implemented some new functionality which are not available in Original STL:

    - First Occurance of a particular element in the given list.

    - Last Occurance of a particular element in the given list.

    - total number of Occurance of a particular element in the given list.

    - Reverse the list.
